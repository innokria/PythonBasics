# Python Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Basic Python Concepts
- **Q1**: What are Python's key features? Why is Python called an interpreted language?
  - **A1**: Python is dynamically typed, interpreted, and supports object-oriented and functional programming. It's called interpreted because Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter.

- **Q2**: Explain the difference between `list`, `tuple`, and `set` in Python.
  - **A2**: `List`: Ordered, mutable. `Tuple`: Ordered, immutable. `Set`: Unordered, mutable, unique elements.

- **Q3**: How does Python's memory management work? What is garbage collection?
  - **A3**: Python uses a private heap to store objects. The `gc` module helps with garbage collection using reference counting and cyclic garbage collector.

## 2. Data Structures
- **Q1**: How do you implement a stack and queue in Python?
  - **A1**: Implement stack using a list (`append`/`pop`), and queue using `collections.deque`.

- **Q2**: How does Python handle dictionaries? Explain how dictionaries are optimized for lookups.
  - **A2**: Dictionaries use a hash table for fast key-value lookups (O(1) on average).

- **Q3**: What are list comprehensions and when would you use them?
  - **A3**: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using loops and conditions.

## 3. Functions and OOP
- **Q1**: Explain the difference between *args and **kwargs in Python.
  - **A1**: `*args` collects positional arguments as a tuple, `**kwargs` collects keyword arguments as a dictionary.

- **Q2**: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy? How can you create them?
  - **A2**: Shallow copy copies only references to objects, deep copy duplicates everything recursively.

- **Q3**: How does Python's method resolution order (MRO) work in multiple inheritance?
  - **A3**: MRO determines the order in which base classes are searched when invoking methods, following the C3 Linearization algorithm.

## 4. Error Handling and Debugging
- **Q1**: How does Python's `try-except` block work? Can you catch multiple exceptions at once?
  - **A1**: `try-except` blocks handle exceptions, and multiple exceptions can be caught using tuples (`except (TypeError, ValueError)`).

- **Q2**: How do you debug a Python program?
  - **A2**: Use debugging tools like `pdb`, IDE debuggers, or print/logging for tracing errors.

- **Q3**: What is the use of the `finally` block in exception handling?
  - **A3**: `finally` ensures code execution regardless of whether an exception occurred.

## 5. Libraries and Modules
- **Q1**: What is the difference between a module and a package in Python?
  - **A1**: A module is a single file of Python code, while a package is a collection of modules organized in directories.

- **Q2**: How would you use `virtualenv` or `venv` to manage dependencies?
  - **A2**: `virtualenv` and `venv` are used to create isolated Python environments to manage dependencies.

- **Q3**: Explain how you would use `requests` or `urllib` to make HTTP requests.
  - **A3**: `requests` provides a simpler interface for making HTTP requests, while `urllib` is more low-level.

## 6. File I/O and Serialization
- **Q1**: How do you read and write files in Python? What are the different modes for file I/O?
  - **A1**: Open files with `open()`, using modes like `'r'` (read), `'w'` (write), `'a'` (append), `'b'` (binary).

- **Q2**: What is the difference between JSON and Pickle in Python? How would you use them to serialize data?
  - **A2**: JSON is human-readable, text-based, and language-independent; `Pickle` serializes Python objects (binary format, not human-readable).

## 7. Concurrency and Parallelism
- **Q1**: What is the `GIL` (Global Interpreter Lock), and how does it affect Python's multithreading?
  - **A1**: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, limiting true parallelism in threads.

- **Q2**: Explain the difference between `threading` and `multiprocessing` in Python.
  - **A2**: `threading` is for I/O-bound tasks, `multiprocessing` is for CPU-bound tasks (uses separate processes).

- **Q3**: What is an `asyncio` task, and how does async/await work in Python?
  - **A3**: `asyncio` allows asynchronous programming with tasks that yield control using `async` and `await`.

## 8. Algorithms and Problem-Solving
- **Q1**: Write a Python program to reverse a string recursively.
  ```python
  def reverse_string(s):
      if len(s) == 0:
          return s
      return reverse_string(s[1:]) + s[0]






Q1: A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function. Example:
python
Copy code
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper
Q2: Generators use yield to return values lazily, creating an iterator.
Q3: dataclasses allow you to create classes with minimal boilerplate by automatically generating methods like __init__ and __repr__.
10. Web Development and APIs
Q1: Use Flask or FastAPI to create a RESTful API. Example in Flask:
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api')
def hello():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
Q2: WSGI is the standard interface between web servers and Python web applications/frameworks (e.g., Flask).
Q3: Use PyJWT or authlib to implement JWT authentication in Python web applications.
11. Testing and CI/CD
Q1: Unit testing example with pytest:
python
Copy code
def test_sum():
    assert sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
Q2: Set up a pipeline using GitHub Actions with a .yml file, defining steps for testing, building, and deploying.
Q3: requirements.txt specifies dependencies, and pyproject.toml manages configurations in modern Python projects.
12. Popular Libraries and Frameworks
Q1: Matrix multiplication in NumPy:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
np.dot(A, B)
Q2: Pandas can clean and transform data:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']
Q3: SQLAlchemy provides an ORM for database interactions:
python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
